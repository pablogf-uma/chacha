- [RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-agl-tls-chacha20poly1305-04#section-7)

- [Algorithm Explanation](https://musigma.blog/2021/02/06/chacha.html)

<h2> Introductory Questions:</h2>

- What is a stream cipher and what does it make a stream cipher different than a block cipher?


- What is an AEAD?


- What is Poly1305?
